        "title": "Education as opportunity? The causal effect of education on labor market outcomes in Jordan",
        "authors": "Daniel Hicks and Huiqiong Duan",
        "year": "2023",
        "abstract": "This paper studies the impact of the 1988/1989 educational reform in Jordan which extended mandatory schooling from nine to ten years and restructured secondary schooling. Despite weakness in the Jordanian labor market, our estimates suggest that an additional year of required schooling in the late 1980s was sufficient to improve labor force participation, employment, and wages. These effects were initially largest for women, while males with more education were also slightly more likely to be self-employed, work longer hours, and earn higher wages. We show that the extensive margin gains we observe for women persist over the life cycle, while intensive margin gains materialize only later in life. In contrast, the impacts for men strengthen over the life-cycle. These patterns are consistent with a persistent influence of traditional gender norms in Jordanian society influencing labor market decision making.",

        "title": "Gendered travel mode choice: a focus on car deficient households",
        "authors": "Joachim Scheiner and Christian Holz-Rau",
        "year": "2012",
        "abstract": "This paper studies travel mode choice with a focus on car use in car deficient households from a gender perspective. Car deficient households are defined as households with more drivers than cars. We derive some key hypotheses from the literature and use the German Mobility Panel 1994–2008 to simultaneously test some of these hypotheses in a pooled data approach with cluster robust regression techniques. We find support for the social roles hypothesis which claims that mode choice may be impacted by the gendered roles a person takes in a household. Participation in paid work does not systematically affect car use more strongly than participation in unpaid work. Thus, there is no support for the economic power hypothesis which claims that car access is a function of intrahousehold economic power. The strong effect of ’sex’ leads us to conclude that there must be more behind gender differences in mode choice than just social roles. Gender differences in travel mode choice even in households with as many cars as drivers suggest that preferences may be at play. The paper concludes with an outlook on further research.",

        "title": "Effect of Employment Site Characteristics on Commute Mode Choice",
        "authors": "Yoram Shiftan and Yotam Barlach",
        "year": "2002",
        "abstract": "Considerable effort has been made in recent years to resolve traffic congestion problems in metropolitan areas. The effects of employment site characteristics on commuting mode choice in the metropolitan area of Haifa, Israel, were studied. The analysis is based on trip diary data that included 4,794 commuting trips. In the first part of the investigation, the effect of different types of employment site on commuting mode choice was studied through aggregate analysis. In the second part, a four-mode multinomial model was developed. The results show a high rate of commuting by private vehicles in which the commuter is the driver. Commuters who have access to a private car are most likely to use it. High rates of commuting by bus are reported to employment sites located near the metropolitan central business district, local business employment sites, and areas with a high frequency of bus services. High rates of commuting by employer-provided transport were identified to suburban sites, industry sites, and areas with a low frequency of bus service. The research concludes that although automobile availability is the most important factor in mode choice, some employment site variables also have significant explanatory power.",

        "title": "Dropout and Enrollment Trends in the Post-War Period: What Went Wrong in the 1970s?",
        "authors": "David Card & Thomas Lemieux",
        "year": "2000",
        "abstract": "Over most of the 20th century successive generations of U.S. children had higher enrollment rates and rising levels of completed education. This trend reversed with the baby boom cohorts who attended school in the 1970s, and only resumed in the mid-1980s. Even today, the college entry rate of male high school seniors is not much higher than it was in 1968. In this paper, we use a variety of data sources to address the question What went wrong in the 1970s?' We focus on both demand-side factors and on a particular supply-side variable the relative size of the cohort currently in school. We find that tuition costs and local unemployment rates affect schooling decisions, although neither variable explains recent trends in enrollment or completed education. We also find that larger cohorts have lower schooling attainment, and that aggregate enrollment rates are correlated with changes in the earnings gains associated with a college degree. For women, our results suggest that the slowdown in education in the 1970s was a temporary response to large cohort sizes and low returns to education. For men, however, the decline in enrollment rates in the 1970s and slow recovery in the 1980s point to a permanent shift in the inter-cohort trend in educational attainment that will affect U.S. economic growth and trends in inequality for many decades to come.",

        "authors": "Innessa Colaiacovo, Margaret Dalton, Sari Pekkala Kerr, and William R. Kerr",
        "year": "2022",
        "abstract": "Over the past half-century, while self-employment has consistently accounted for around one in ten of the United States workforce, its composition has changed. Since 1970, industries with high startup capital requirements have declined from 53% of self-employment to 23%. This same time period also witnessed declines in “hometown” local entrepreneurship and the probability of the self-employed being among top earners. Using 2016 data, we show that high startup capital requirements are linked with lower profitability at small scales. The transition away from high startup capital industries appears most closely linked to changes in small business production functions and less due to advantageous reallocation to other opportunities, growth in returns-to-scale among large businesses, or a worsening of financing conditions and debt levels.",

        "authors": "JOACHIM SCHEINER",
        "year": "2011",
        "abstract": "Internal migration intensities fluctuate over time, but both migration levels and trends show great diversity. The dynamics underpinning these trends remain poorly understood because they are analyzed almost exclusively by applying period measures to cross-sectional data. This article proposes 10 cohort measures that can be applied to both prospective and retrospective data to systematically examine long-term trends. To demonstrate their benefits, the proposed measures are applied to retrospective survey data for England that provide residential histories from birth to age 50 for cohorts born between 1918 and 1957. The analysis reveals stable lifetime migration for men but increased lifetime migration for women associated with earlier ages at moving in adulthood and a compression of intervals between consecutive moves. The proposed cohort measures provide a more comprehensive picture of migration behavior and should be used to complement period measures in exploring long-term trends. Increasing availability of retrospective and longitudinal survey data means that researchers can now apply the proposed measures to a wide range of countries.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies changes in people's travel mode choice from one year to the next. The data used is the German Mobility Panel (GMP) 1994 to 2008 in which households and their members are asked three times in three subsequent years to report the trips they made over a week. The changes reported are regressed to key events over the life course, cohort effects and period effects, while various sociodemographic and spatial attributes are controlled. This research is informed by three distinct discourses: behavioural change, the mobility biographies approach, and cohort analysis. In the next section the state of the research is introduced. Subsequently, the data and the methodology are described, followed by the results. The paper finishes with an outlook to further research. ",

        "year": "2022",
        "abstract": "Although rural-to-urban migration has been well researched, how gender shapes processes and outcomes, including later-life health outcomes, has not been thoroughly investigated. Guided by a life course perspective, this study explores gender differences in rural-urban migration patterns and its association with depression in later life among Chinese older adults. Exploiting rich life history data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, we employ sequence analysis to identify the typical migration trajectories of Chinese older adults. Moderated mediation analysis is then used to examine gender-specific health pathways linking migration trajectories and later-life depression. The results indicate that: rural migrants who settled in urban regions have lower level of depression in later life than ‘return migrants' who moved back to rural areas or those who were rural non-migrants; the gender gap in depression is marginally smaller among early urban settlers than rural non-migrants; and household income in later life has stronger mediation effects for migrant men than for migrant women. The study therefore highlights the importance of considering the role of gender when designing policies aiming to improve the health and wellbeing of migrants in later life.",

        "abstract": "The terrain of gender inequalities in education has seen much change in recent decades. This article reviews the empirical research and theoretical perspectives on gender inequalities in educational performance and attainment from early childhood to young adulthood. Much of the literature on children and adolescents attends to performance differences between girls and boys. Of course, achievement in elementary and secondary school is linked to the level of education one ultimately attains including high school completion, enrollment in postsecondary education, college completion, and graduate and professional school experiences. We recommend three directions for future research: (a) interdisciplinary efforts to understand gender differences in cognitive development and noncognitive abilities in early childhood, (b) research on the structure and practices of schooling, and (c) analyses of how gender differences might amplify other kinds of inequalities, such as racial, ethnic, class, or nativity inequalities.",

Results showed that rural students were more advantaged in community social resources compared to nonrural students, and these resources were associated with a significant increase in the likelihood of bachelor's degree attainment. Yet results confirmed that rural students lagged behind nonrural students in attaining a bachelor's degree largely due to their lower socioeconomic background. The findings present a more comprehensive picture of the complexity of geographic residence in shaping college enrollment and degree attainment.",

        "abstract": "We study the impact of improved rail access on entrepreneurship rates in England and Wales. We use data from the Census spanning 2001, 2011, and 2021 to analyse self-employment rates in granular geographic areas of around 200 residents. Specifically, we study how they respond to changes in the distance to the nearest train station occurring due to 56 new station openings. We find that all else equal, moving 1 km further away from a station reduces self-employment rates by 0.12 percentage points, with the effect dissipating beyond 7 km. Secondary results suggest that access to rail makes it easier to become self-employed while not making it more attractive compared to employment. Our findings suggest that rail infrastructure improvements can support local entrepreneurship and economic activity, contributing to regional development and reducing economic inequality.",

        "year": "2021",
        "abstract": "Many studies have demonstrated that the built environment has a strong impact on people's travel mode choice. However, the built environment also influences elements such as travel distance and car ownership, which might be the true predictors of which travel modes are chosen. In this study, we analyse the effects of changes in residential neighbourhood on changes in travel mode (for commute trips and leisure trips), both directly and indirectly through changes in car ownership, travel distances and travel attitudes. This study applies a structural equation modelling approach using quasi-longitudinal data from 1650 recently relocated residents in the city of Ghent, Belgium. Results indicate that the built environment has strong direct effects on active leisure trips and car use. However, distance (for car use) and attitudes (for active travel) were found to be important mediating variables. In sum, the effect of the built environment on travel mode choice might be more complex than commonly assumed as it partly seems mediated by travel distance and travel attitudes.",
