The json file (full_synth_epi_hypertension_literature.json) is an example set of papers that was used for the experiments. Websearch can be enabled instead of json upload of pre-determined papers by swapping out LIT_1 db episode in this file "Causality-Copilot/src/climb/engine/engine_openai_causality.py" (swap the episode labelled "# Retrieve papers from web search" in as the `"LIT_1"` episode).
